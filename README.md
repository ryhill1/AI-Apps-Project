**Power BI - Visualising Invoice Insights**

After automating the extraction and storage process, I developed a Power BI Report to provide clear, actionable insights from the invoice data. My focus was on creating a fast, intuitive and accessible dashboard that could be used by varying members of the business with individual levels of business experience. 

**Business Objective**
The initial goal was to gain visibility into invoice contents, because of this I focussed on highlighting the entire contents of the invoice. I provided insights into the different charges and service titles. Users should be able to directly compare the invoice data against internal data. 
During the project the focus changed, I was now to create visuals which would identify the unexpected surcharges which were listed on the invoices. 

**ETL & Data Preparation**
Using **Power Query**, I built a robust ETL process to:
1 - Clean and transform the data extracted by the AI Model
2 - Handle inconsistencies in formatting 
3 - Ensure accuracy and reliability across all carrier datasets

**Design Principles**
I followed key dashboard design principles to ensure clarity and usability:
1 - Minimalist layout: Focused on essential metrics to avoid overwhelming users
2 - Bookmark navigation: I used Power BI's bookmark feature to create an interactive experiece, allowing users to switch between carriers and fees without cluttering the interface
3 - Consistent formatting: Applied uniform colour schemes, fonts and filters to maintain a professional and cohesive appearance.

**Key Features**
1 - Invoice Summary View: Displays high-level metrics such as total invoice value, invoice period and a carrier breakdown. 
2 - Surcharge Analysis: A dedicated page for exploring surcharge trends and anomolies.
3 - Comparison Metrics: Enables users to compare invoices against expected internal figures using the generated invoice period.
