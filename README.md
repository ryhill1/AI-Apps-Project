**AI Model: Microsoft AI Builder Invoice Data Extraction**

I had previously never used the AI Builder but was aware of it's abilities through experimenting with Power Apps. I took this opportunity to integrate a personal interest with a professional project. 

The invoices we received from four carriers varied drastically in format and structure. AI Builder's form processing model offered the flexible integrated solution that would be capable of dealing with my unique scenario. 

As this was my first time using AI Builder and a first for anyone in my area of the business. I would be given little practical support so I approached the challenge with a self-taught and detirmined mindset, testing different configurations and training strategies to optimise accuracy and consistency. 

I completed the project with an accuracy score of 80%, this felt like an appropriate score based on the varying quality of certain documents. I understood that with this score I would need a strong ETL process to ensure efficiency in my Power BI Report.
