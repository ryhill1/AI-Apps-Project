This project was developed to automate a manual invoice processing workflow involving four carriers, each with unique invoice formats. 
The original process was time-consuming and prone to error, requiring manual review and complaint handling.

Using Microsoft Power Platform toolsâ€”AI Builder, Power Automate, and Power BI. 
I created an end-to-end solution that extracts, processes, and visualizes invoice data with minimal user input. 
The system includes SharePoint integration, Excel-based data storage, and a user-friendly BI dashboard.

The project prioritizes simplicity, efficiency, and accessibility, ensuring that even team members with limited technical experience can use it effectively. 
This repository documents the full development process, including automation logic, data handling, and dashboard design.
